I'm Luigi, born in 1997, software engineer based in Naples ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ ðŸŒŠ with 5+ years of experience specialized in Web development. I'm currently working at Intellipse.

I love Open Source and participate to community events and I also speak at conference like Linux Day and Merge-It. 


I'm a self-taught and I strongly believe in the spirit of knowledge sharing, so I decided to start free [mentoring](https://calendly.com/gigitux/45min?month=2021-03)
